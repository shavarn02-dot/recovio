const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the very first thing I should do when a client disputes an invoice?",
    a: "Immediately pause all automated payment reminders and dunning emails for that specific invoice. If your automated billing tool sends a past-due notice 2 days later while the client is waiting for you to resolve their dispute, you will infuriate them and damage the business relationship.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a client refuse to pay the whole invoice if they only dispute one line item?",
    a: "No. You should politely request that the client release payment for the undisputed portion of the invoice immediately, while both parties work together to resolve the specific disputed line item. Never let a $500 dispute hold up a $10,000 payment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if a dispute is genuine or just a delay tactic?",
    a: "Genuine disputes point to specific line items, purchase order numbers, or unapproved scope additions within 1 to 2 business days of receiving the invoice. Stalling tactics typically occur 30+ days after the due date with vague statements like 'We aren't happy with the project' or 'We need to review our budget.'",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Recovio prevent customer friction when disputes occur?",
    a: "Recovio's NLP Dispute Triage Agent automatically intercepts incoming email replies to invoices. If it detects pushback, pricing disagreements, or missing PO claims, it freezes automated reminders instantly and pre-drafts a polite response referencing your contract or PO for your one-click review.",
  },

Hi {clientName},

Thank you for reaching out regarding Invoice #{invoiceNumber}. We value our partnership, and I appreciate you bringing this discrepancy to our attention so we can resolve it quickly and fairly.

We reviewed your notes alongside our project agreement and internal delivery records:
• Undisputed Core Scope: The primary deliverables completed under PO #{poNumber} total {undisputedAmount}.
• Disputed Item: The {disputedAmount} variance relates to {briefReason, e.g., expedited courier delivery / out-of-scope revisions requested on June 14th}.

To keep everything moving forward seamlessly:
1. We have immediately paused automated payment reminders for this invoice on our end while we work through this together.
2. Could your accounts team release payment for the undisputed portion ({undisputedAmount}) while we review the documentation for the remaining {disputedAmount}?
3. Attached please find our {supportingDocumentName, e.g., signed change request / timesheet breakdown} for your review.

Would you have 10 minutes tomorrow at {suggestedTime} for a brief call to align on this, or would you prefer us to issue an adjusted statement?

Best regards,
{senderName}
{senderTitle}
{senderCompany}`;
