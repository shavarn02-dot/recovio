Thank you for the update. To assist your vendor onboarding and compliance team, please find attached our updated tax documentation:

Thank you for reaching out transparently about your cash flow timing. We truly appreciate you contacting us proactively rather than letting the invoice go unaddressed.

We value our ongoing relationship and are happy to support your team with a structured installment plan:

Option: 2-Part Milestone Settlement
• Installment 1: {firstPaymentAmount} (50%) due by {firstPaymentDate}
• Installment 2: {secondPaymentAmount} (50%) due by {secondPaymentDate}

You can confirm this plan and set up the first milestone payment directly through our automated portal:
{installmentSetupLink}

Once Installment 1 is initiated, all automated past-due notices will be snoozed, and reminders will only trigger 3 days prior to Installment 2.

Does this schedule align with your cash flow forecast? Let me know and we will lock this in on your account ledger.

Our finance desk reconciles incoming bank settlements daily at 4:00 PM EST. Bank wires and ACH transfers typically take 1 to 2 business days to clear interbank settlement.

To ensure your account is protected:
1. We have immediately snoozed all automated collection reminders for 72 hours while funds settle.
2. If you have the bank confirmation or remittance advice PDF handy, feel free to reply with it attached so we can mark your ledger account as 'Payment Pending Verification'.

We will send an automated receipt confirmation the moment the deposit clears our account.

Thank you again for your prompt handling!

  },
  {
    q: "How should a finance team organize a shared accounts receivable mailbox?",
    a: "Standardize naming conventions, create categorized subfolders (Disputes, Tax/W-9, Payment Promises, Remittance), and establish a strict rule: every customer inquiry must be acknowledged within 4 hours. Better yet, deploy an AR query management platform like Recovio that categorizes inquiries and pauses collection cadences automatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why shouldn't we just use Zendesk or Freshdesk for billing emails?",
    a: "General-purpose helpdesks are designed for customer support tickets, not financial receivables. They assign sterile ticket numbers (e.g. 'Ticket #49201') that look impersonal, lack native ledger synchronization, cannot pause dunning email sequences, and don't provide encrypted payment settlement links.",

    q: "How does Recovio eliminate repetitive invoice copy requests?",

    q: "What happens when a client replies with a question about their invoice?",
    a: "Recovio's NLP agent catches the reply via webhook, classifies it as an inquiry (e.g., vendor onboarding, tax form request, bank wire details), puts the overdue reminder cadence on temporary hold, and pre-drafts a response with the required documents attached for your 1-click approval.",
