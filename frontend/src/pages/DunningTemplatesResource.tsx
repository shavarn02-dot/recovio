const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Why do static dunning email templates stop working over time?",
    a: "Static email templates suffer from 'template blindness' and spam filter degradation. When a debtor receives three identical or boilerplate dunning emails with the exact same phrasing, they tune it out or mark it as junk. Modern email filters (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365) detect repetitive templated emails and divert them to the spam or promotional folder. Recovio solves this by utilizing Groq LLaMA 3.1 inference to dynamically generate unique, context-aware emails tailored to aging, amount, and prior responsiveness.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the optimal cadence frequency for B2B collection emails?",
    a: "The most effective B2B cadence follows an exponential timeline: a courtesy notice at Day -3, a reminder on Day 1, followed by touches on Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 30. Blasting emails every 2 days damages client goodwill and triggers mailer spam flags. Recovio enforces an automated 20-Hour Idempotency Guard to guarantee no debtor receives multiple touches in less than 20 hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Stage 5 Legal Stop in accounts receivable automation?",
    a: "Once an invoice reaches 31+ days overdue (Stage 5), continuing to send automated generative AI follow-ups poses compliance risks under debt collection regulations and damages legal enforceability. Recovio's Stage 5 Legal Stop automatically freezes automated communication, locks the audit trail, and escalates the file to human finance leadership for manual legal counsel review.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include a payment link directly in every dunning email?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely. Forcing a debtor to log in to an enterprise portal with a forgotten password or manually look up bank account wiring details adds immense friction. Recovio embeds cryptographic, zero-login payment links (/i/:token) that allow debtors to view their invoice statement and pay instantly via Razorpay (UPI, NetBanking, Cards, or Virtual Bank Accounts) with zero login credentials required.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Recovio handle inbound replies to these dunning emails?",
    a: "Unlike static template tools that ignore incoming replies, Recovio's DisputeAgent (ai-service/src/agents/dispute_agent.py) parses inbound debtor emails using NLP sentiment classification. If a client replies stating that goods were damaged or that an invoice line item was incorrect, Recovio immediately tags the invoice as 'dispute', halts all automated dunning cadences, and alerts the finance team with a pre-drafted resolution response.",
