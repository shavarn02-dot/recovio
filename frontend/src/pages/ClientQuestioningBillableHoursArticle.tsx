const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Should I immediately offer a discount when a client questions my billable hours?",
    a: "No. Slashing your fees immediately implies that your original invoice was inflated, inaccurate, or negotiable. First, acknowledge their concern politely, provide an itemized breakdown of the time logged with deliverables, and ask for specific line items they are unsure about. Adjustments should only be considered if a genuine clerical error was made.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly should I reply to a client questioning invoice hours?",
    a: "Within 24 hours. Waiting longer makes the client feel ignored or defensive, which hardens their position and jeopardizes future retainers. An initial prompt response acknowledging the question de-escalates the tension immediately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the client refuse to pay the entire invoice while disputing some hours?",
    a: "No. You should politely request that the client release payment for the undisputed base portion of the invoice immediately, while both parties work together to review the specific disputed hours. This keeps cash flow moving and isolates the disagreement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does automated AR software like Recovio help with billable hour questions?",
    a: "When a client replies questioning invoice hours, traditional dunning bots blindly continue sending aggressive past-due reminders. Recovio's NLP automatically detects the inquiry, freezes automated reminder emails on that invoice immediately, and drafts a documented reply for your 1-click review.",

Hi {clientName},

Thank you for reaching out regarding Invoice #{invoiceNumber}. I appreciate you bringing your questions regarding the logged hours to our attention, and I want to ensure we give you complete clarity.

To make this completely transparent, I have attached our detailed activity log for this billing cycle, which includes:
• Timestamped task descriptions and deliverables completed.
• Team member attribution for each milestone.
• References to the project deliverables agreed upon in our project brief.

Specifically, the {disputedHours} hours you noted were dedicated to {briefExplanationOfWork, e.g., resolving the unexpected database migration bottlenecks discussed in our sprint review}.

Could you review the attached log and let me know which specific items or tasks look different than what you anticipated? If helpful, I am also happy to jump on a quick 10-minute call tomorrow at {suggestedTime} to walk through the log together.

In the meantime, we have placed automated reminders for this invoice on temporary hold so you won't receive any automated notices while we review this.

Best regards,
{senderName}
{senderCompany}`;

  const script2 = `Subject: Regarding your questions on Invoice #{invoiceNumber}

Hi {clientName},

Thank you for reaching out with your questions regarding Invoice #{invoiceNumber}. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, and I want to ensure we clear up any confusion quickly.

To help me address your concerns most effectively, could you please provide a little more detail on which specific hours or line items look different than what you expected?

Once I have that information, I will review our internal activity logs and the original project scope to provide you with a comprehensive breakdown.

In the interim, we have paused payment follow-up reminders for this invoice on our end.

Warm regards,

              1. Why Clients Question Billable Hours (It's Rarely Malice)
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When a client questions your billable hours, your immediate instinct is often anger or anxiety. You might feel accused of dishonesty or wonder if they're trying to nickel-and-dime you out of your hard-earned money.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In reality, over <strong>85% of billable hour disputes stem from surprise, not malice</strong>. Clients don't see the behind-the-scenes complexity of software debugging, design iterations, or regulatory compliance reviews. When the total dollar amount exceeds the rough mental estimate they had in mind, their natural reaction is to ask for clarity.
            </p>

              <p className="text-zinc-400">
                Do not view their email as an accusation. View it as an administrative request for clarity. When you approach the conversation with curiosity and transparency rather than defensiveness, the tension evaporates.

                <p className="text-sm text-zinc-400">
                  Offering a 15% discount in your first response is a massive strategic mistake. It immediately signals to the client that your original billing was arbitrary, padded, or negotiable. Only offer adjustments if an honest review reveals a genuine duplicate or clerical error.

                  Replies like <em>"I've been doing this for 10 years, and my rates are very standard"</em> make the client feel alienated. Keep emotional pride out of the response. Let cold, objective timestamped work logs speak for you.

                <p className="text-sm text-zinc-400">
                  If your accounting software is set to automatically email <em>"REMINDER: Your invoice is 7 days overdue"</em> while the client is waiting for you to explain the hours, they will be furious. You must pause collection cadences the second an inquiry arrives.

              Handling billable hours questions manually works fine when you have 3 clients. But when you manage 20 or 50 active client retainers, the risk of embarrassing mistakes skyrockets.
            </p>

            <p className="text-sm text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The biggest nightmare is when a client replies with a thoughtful question about their invoice hours, but your automated accounting software (like QuickBooks, Chaser, or Upflow) blindly continues to send aggressive payment reminders threatening late fees. It humiliates the client and can ruin an annual contract.
