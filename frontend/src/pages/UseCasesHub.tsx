const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does Recovio prevent damage to customer and client relationships?",
    a: "Generic dunning software sends repetitive, robotic notices that sound cold and aggressive. Recovio uses Groq LLaMA 3.1 to generate respectful, relationship-first communications across 5 distinct stages—starting with a gentle courtesy reminder and only escalating if an invoice remains unpaid for weeks. The tone is always professional, polite, and aligned with standard B2B commercial etiquette.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when a debtor replies with a question or dispute?",
    a: "If a debtor replies saying 'we already paid this yesterday', 'the billed amount is incorrect', or 'waiting on manager approval', Recovio's AI DisputeAgent immediately detects the objection. It instantly freezes all automated follow-ups for that invoice so you never embarrass your company by sending reminders during an active conversation, alerts your team, and drafts an AI-suggested reply for your review.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can debtors settle invoices directly without creating an account or logging in?",
    a: "Yes. Every follow-up email includes a secure, tokenized payment link (`/i/:token`). When your client clicks it, they see their invoice details and can settle immediately via Razorpay, credit card, NetBanking, or UPI in 60 seconds without creating a password or logging into an account.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Recovio help when a debtor cannot pay the full balance upfront?",
    a: "Demanding 100% immediate payment from a customer facing temporary cash constraints often causes them to ignore messages entirely. Recovio allows you to offer flexible, structured installment payment plans (2x, 3x, or 4x installments). Debtors can self-select an installment schedule via their payment link, turning default risk into predictable cash inflows.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Recovio replace our existing accounting or invoicing software?",
    a: "No. Recovio does not replace QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe, or your back-office billing systems. Instead, Recovio connects to your invoices, tracks payment statuses, runs automated follow-up cadences, handles dispute detection, and reconciles payments back to your records automatically.",
