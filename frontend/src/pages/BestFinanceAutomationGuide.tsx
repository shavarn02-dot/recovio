  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "What is the difference between Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR) automation?",
      a: "Accounts Payable (AP) automation focuses on money flowing out of your business—ingesting supplier bills, extracting data via OCR, routing manager approvals, and executing vendor disbursements (handled by tools like Ramp or Tipalti). Accounts Receivable (AR) automation focuses on money flowing into your business—following up on unpaid customer invoices, triaging billing disputes, modulating escalation tone, and accelerating cash collection (handled by Recovio).",
    },
    {
      q: "Why do traditional email template sequences fail to get overdue invoices paid?",
      a: "Traditional template tools (such as Upflow or Chaser) blast the exact same static email copy on Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21. Debtors quickly develop 'template blindness' and tune them out. Worse, repetitive boilerplate wording with spam trigger phrases ('URGENT PAYMENT REQUIRED') causes Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace filters to flag your domain, diverting your invoices to spam. Modern tools like Recovio solve this by using generative AI to synthesize unique, context-aware emails for every touch.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does Recovio fit into an existing finance stack alongside QuickBooks, Xero, or NetSuite?",
      a: "Recovio does not replace your core general ledger or ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, Xero). Instead, it sits directly on top of your existing accounting system as an autonomous AR execution agent. Recovio syncs open invoices, executes multi-stage follow-ups, catches inbound reply disputes, and syncs cleared payments back to your ledger in real time via webhooks.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens when a debtor replies to an automated collection email?",
      a: "With legacy tools, automated sequences keep firing even after a client replies with an invoice question or dispute, creating massive customer friction. Recovio includes an NLP DisputeAgent that intercepts inbound replies in real time. If the customer reports a billing error or promises payment on a future date, Recovio immediately freezes outbound reminders and drafts a suggested resolution for finance approval.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can finance teams test Recovio without replacing their existing accounting setup?",
      a: "Yes. Recovio connects via API or simple CSV ledger import in under 15 minutes. It is 100% free during Early Access with zero credit card required, allowing finance controllers to benchmark recovery velocity and DSO reduction alongside their current setup.",

                Most finance teams still close the books, apply cash, and follow up on customer receivables by stitching together spreadsheets, repetitive email templates, and disconnected point tools. This operational friction shows up as elevated Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), payment dispute bottlenecks, and avoidable bad debt write-offs. Finance automation tools solve this by replacing manual execution with policy-gated automation directly integrated into your accounting data.

                    Modern Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 AI algorithms detect identical template bodies sent repeatedly. When 50 debtors receive the exact same dunning template, recipient servers downgrade your corporate domain sender reputation, pushing your regular commercial emails into spam.

                    Accounts payable staff process hundreds of invoices weekly. Forcing them to create a username and remember a password just to view an invoice statement leads to a 70%+ portal drop-off rate. 1-click tokenized URLs (<code className="text-xs text-[#b7d2f8]">/i/:token</code>) eliminate this friction.

                    When cash-strapped debtors cannot afford a full $25,000 payment, demanding 100% settlement forces them into hiding. Empowering them with self-service 2x, 3x, or 4x installment schedules recovers working capital while preserving commercial goodwill.

                How to Choose the Right Finance Automation Solution
              </h2>
              <p className="text-sm text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
                When evaluating finance automation platforms, finance directors routinely make three expensive mistakes:
              </p>

              <div className="space-y-4 text-sm text-zinc-300">
                <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-[#0a0a0b] border border-white/[0.06]">
                  <strong className="text-white block mb-1">Mistake 1: Purchasing an enterprise suite for a mid-market team</strong>
                  <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-zinc-400">
                    Tools like HighRadius are built for Global 2000 companies with dedicated IT consulting budgets. For fast-growing businesses with 5 to 50 employees, a 9-month implementation cycle delays cash flow recovery and generates massive consulting overhead.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-[#0a0a0b] border border-white/[0.06]">
                  <strong className="text-white block mb-1">Mistake 2: Confusing Accounts Payable (money out) with Accounts Receivable (money in)</strong>
                  <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-zinc-400">
                    Ramp and Tipalti are category-defining platforms for managing corporate expenses and vendor disbursements. However, they do not collect customer receivables. High-impact finance teams deploy Ramp for AP and pair it with Recovio for autonomous AR collections.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-[#0a0a0b] border border-white/[0.06]">
                  <strong className="text-white block mb-1">Mistake 3: Overlooking debtor dispute and reply handling</strong>
                  <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-zinc-400">
                    Over 40% of overdue invoices stem from billing inquiries or purchase order disputes rather than intentional default. If your software cannot triage replies automatically, you will alienate high-value customers with robotic follow-up spam.
