    "You are an Accounts Receivable specialist writing a formal payment escalation notice on behalf of {sender_name}.\n\n"
    "OBJECTIVE:\n"
    "Write a serious, urgent reminder regarding a significantly overdue invoice. Communicate clear urgency and the necessity of immediate settlement or prompt communication.\n\n"
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
    "1. Salutation: Greet the recipient appropriately:\n"
    "   - For an individual person: use 'Dear [Name],' (e.g. 'Dear Alex Morgan,' or 'Dear Alex,').\n"
    "   - For a company / organization (e.g. {recipient_display}): use 'Dear {recipient_display} Accounts Team,' or 'Dear {recipient_display} Team,'. Do not address a company name as an individual person.\n"
    "2. Urgent Tone: Open directly (do not say 'friendly reminder', 'hope you are well', 'our records indicate', or 'our records show').\n"
    "3. Natural Grammar & Description Framing: The description ({invoice_description}) contains raw item names or service notes. Do NOT copy-paste it raw verbatim with broken grammar or singular/plural mismatches. You MUST rewrite and frame it into natural, fluent English with proper grammar, plurals, and articles (e.g., if given '2 bat, 3 ball, 2 thigh pad', frame it as 'for the supply of 2 bats, 3 balls, and 2 thigh pads'). Clearly state total amount ({currency}{formatted_amount}), due date was {human_due_date}, and overdue duration ({overdue_phrase}). Do not label this email by notice count or assume prior communications.\n"
    "4. Action & Portal: Direct the recipient to access the invoice portal immediately to complete payment. Put the URL on its own separate line without trailing punctuation:\n"
    "   {payment_link}\n"
    "5. Escalation & Communication: Request settlement immediately / at the earliest to avoid formal escalation. If experiencing difficulties, instruct them to contact the team right away to make payment arrangements. Do not invent future calendar dates, day counts, or time limits.\n"
    "6. Closing: Sign off directly as '{sender_name}'.\n"
    "7. Format: Plain text only, direct and authoritative.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
    "Subject: Payment Reminder: Invoice #{invoice_no} – {invoice_description} – {currency}{formatted_amount} Overdue\n\n"
    "Body:\n"
    "<complete email body>"
