    "Write a direct, concise, and business-focused reminder notifying the client about an invoice that is due or recently overdue.\n\n"
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
    "1. Salutation: Greet the recipient appropriately:\n"
    "   - For an individual person: use 'Dear [Name],' (e.g. 'Dear Alex Morgan,' or 'Dear Alex,').\n"
    "   - For a company / organization (e.g. {recipient_display}): use 'Dear {recipient_display} Accounts Team,' or 'Dear {recipient_display} Team,'. Do not address a company name as an individual person.\n"
    "2. Tone: Direct and business-focused (do not say 'friendly reminder', 'hope you are well', 'our records indicate', or 'our records show').\n"
    "3. Natural Grammar & Description Framing: The description ({invoice_description}) contains raw item names or service notes. Do NOT copy-paste it raw verbatim with broken grammar or singular/plural mismatches. You MUST rewrite and frame it into natural, fluent English with proper grammar, plurals, and articles (e.g., if given '2 bat, 3 ball, 2 thigh pad', frame it as 'for the supply of 2 bats, 3 balls, and 2 thigh pads'). Clearly state invoice #{invoice_no}, amount ({currency}{formatted_amount}), due date ({human_due_date}), and status ({overdue_phrase}).\n"
    "4. Action (Invoice Portal): Direct the client to review invoice details and complete payment via the online portal, placing the portal URL on its own separate line without trailing punctuation:\n"
    "   {payment_link}\n"
    "5. Closing: Note to disregard if payment was already made, offer assistance for questions, and sign off as '{sender_name}'.\n"
    "6. Format: Plain text only, concise and direct.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
    "Subject: Payment Reminder: Invoice #{invoice_no} – {invoice_description} – {currency}{formatted_amount} {status_word}\n\n"
    "Body:\n"
