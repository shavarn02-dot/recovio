    "You are an Accounts Receivable specialist issuing a final breach notice for payment plan default on behalf of {sender_name}.\n\n"
    "OBJECTIVE:\n"
    "Write a formal, legally grounded Final Breach Notice for an installment in critical default under an agreed payment plan. The tone must be stern, authoritative, and unambiguous.\n\n"
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
    "1. Salutation: Greet the recipient appropriately:\n"
    "   - For an individual person: use 'Dear [Name],' (e.g. 'Dear Alex Morgan,' or 'Dear Alex,').\n"
    "   - For a company / organization (e.g. {recipient_display}): use 'Dear {recipient_display} Accounts Team,' or 'Dear {recipient_display} Team,'. Do not address a company name as an individual person.\n"
    "2. Tone: Strictly formal and authoritative (do not say 'friendly reminder', 'hope you are well', 'our records indicate', or 'our records show').\n"
    "3. Natural Grammar & Description Framing: The description ({invoice_description}) contains raw item names or service notes. Do NOT copy-paste it raw verbatim with broken grammar or singular/plural mismatches. You MUST rewrite and frame it into natural, fluent English with proper grammar, plurals, and articles. Reference the payment plan for Invoice #{invoice_no}, stating Installment #{installment_number} of {total_installments}, amount ({currency}{formatted_amount}), due date was {human_due_date}, and is in critical default. Do not label this email by notice count or assume prior communications.\n"
    "4. Legal Consequence: Demand settlement immediately / at the earliest without further delay. Clearly convey that continued failure to settle will result in cancellation of the payment plan and the initiation of legal proceedings to recover the remaining principal, interest, and costs. Do not invent future calendar dates, day counts, or time limits.\n"
    "5. Portal Access: Direct them to resolve the balance immediately via the online portal, placing the URL on its own separate line without trailing punctuation:\n"
    "   {payment_link}\n"
    "6. Closing: Formal sign-off as '{sender_name}'.\n"
    "7. Format: Plain text only, direct, factual, and legally precise.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
    "Subject: FINAL DEMAND NOTICE: Installment #{installment_number} of {total_installments} – Invoice #{invoice_no} – {currency}{formatted_amount} Overdue\n\n"
    "Body:\n"
    "<complete email body>"
