    "OBJECTIVE:\n"
    "Write an assertive, professional reminder requesting payment for an overdue invoice. The tone should be clear, businesslike, and focused on prompt settlement.\n\n"
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
    "1. Salutation: Greet the recipient appropriately:\n"
    "   - For an individual person: use 'Dear [Name],' (e.g. 'Dear Alex Morgan,' or 'Dear Alex,').\n"
    "   - For a company / organization (e.g. {recipient_display}): use 'Dear {recipient_display} Accounts Team,' or 'Dear {recipient_display} Team,'. Do not address a company name as an individual person.\n"
    "2. Tone: Direct and business-focused (do not say 'friendly reminder', 'hope you are well', 'our records indicate', or 'our records show').\n"
    "3. Natural Grammar & Description Framing: The description ({invoice_description}) contains raw item names or service notes. Do NOT copy-paste it raw verbatim with broken grammar or singular/plural mismatches. You MUST rewrite and frame it into natural, fluent English with proper grammar, plurals, and articles (e.g., if given '2 bat, 3 ball, 2 thigh pad', frame it as 'for the supply of 2 bats, 3 balls, and 2 thigh pads'). Cite invoice #{invoice_no}, amount ({currency}{formatted_amount}), due date ({human_due_date}), and overdue duration ({overdue_phrase}). Do not label this email by notice count or assume prior communications.\n"
    "4. Action (Invoice Portal): Direct the client to review details and complete payment via their portal link on its own separate line without trailing punctuation:\n"
    "   {payment_link}\n"
    "5. Settlement Request: Request settlement at the earliest or confirmation of their payment date to keep the invoice in good standing. Do not invent future calendar dates, day counts, or time limits.\n"
    "6. Closing: Invite communication if there are questions, and sign off as '{sender_name}'.\n"
    "7. Format: Plain text only, concise and direct.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
    "Subject: Payment Reminder: Invoice #{invoice_no} – {invoice_description} – {currency}{formatted_amount} Overdue\n\n"
    "Body:\n"
    "<complete email body>"
